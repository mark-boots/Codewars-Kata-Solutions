Task

Given an array of N integers, you have to find how many times you have to add up the smallest numbers in the array until their Sum becomes greater or equal to K.
Notes:

    List size is at least 3.

    All numbers will be positive.

    Numbers could occur more than once , (Duplications may exist).

    Threshold K will always be reachable.

Input >> Output Examples

minimumSteps({1, 10, 12, 9, 2, 3}, 6)  ==>  return (2)

Explanation:

    We add two smallest elements (1 + 2), their sum is 3 .

    Then we add the next smallest number to it (3 + 3) , so the sum becomes 6 .

    Now the result is greater or equal to 6 , Hence the output is (2) i.e (2) operations are required to do this .

minimumSteps({8 , 9, 4, 2}, 23)  ==> return (3)

function minimumSteps(numbers, value, count = -1){
    numbers.sort((a,b)=>a-b)
    while(value > 0){
      count++
      value -= numbers[count]
    }
    return count;
}

//

const minimumSteps = (numbers,value) => numbers.sort((a,b)=>a-b).filter(v=>(value-=v)>0).length
