Recycle!

You are having a BBQ, and after the BBQ you are left with some rubbish to recycle.

There are 3 recycling boxes: Red: Plastic, Green: Glass, Blue: Card.

You want to sort the rubbish according to the material and return the number of items in each box as an array (or a tuple in Python):

[plastic, glass, card]
The material type can be determined based on the sign of the item's value:

Plastic: value > 0
Glass: value < 0
Card: value = 0
Example
rubbish = [5, -9, 0, 6, -84, -95, 15]
// Plastic = 3, Glass = 3, Card = 1
// Output: [3, 3, 1]
