Racing Grid Validation
https://www.codewars.com/kata/692c80fa12006b05757089dd/train/javascript

Description
In a racing series, all drivers start from a perfectly ordered starting grid. After the race, you are given the moves describing how many positions each driver gained or lost relative to their starting position. A positive value means the driver moved forward (gained places), and a negative value means the driver dropped back (lost places).

Task
Your task is to determine whether this finishing order is valid, assuming that:

The starting grid is perfectly ordered:
No two drivers can start in the same position.
There are no gaps in positions in the starting grid.
No two drivers can finish in the same position.
Every driver finishes the race.
Write a function that:

Takes an array moves of length n, where moves[i] is the number of positions the driver that finished at position i gained (positive) or lost (negative) compared to their starting position.
Returns a boolean indicating whether there exists a valid race result consistent with the moves.
Constraints
2 <= n <= 100.
Examples
moves	Result	Explanation
[2, -1, -1]	True	The driver that started in last position overtook both drivers before him
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]	True	The race finished in the same order as the starting grid
[-1, 1, -1]	False	The winner lost a position, which is invalid
[0, 1, 0]	False	The drivers that ended in second and third position both started last, which is invalid
Good luck, have fun!
