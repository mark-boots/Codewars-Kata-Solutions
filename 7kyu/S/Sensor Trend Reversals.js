Sensor Trend Reversals
A sensor records a sequence of integer readings.

Your task is to count how many times the trend changes between:

increasing
decreasing
A trend reversal occurs when an increasing sequence becomes decreasing, or when a decreasing sequence becomes increasing.

Consecutive equal readings do not create a direction and must be ignored.

Examples
countDirectionChanges([1, 3, 2, 4]);
// 2
The directions are increasing, decreasing, then increasing, so the trend changes twice.

countDirectionChanges([5, 3, 1]);
// 0
The readings are always decreasing.

countDirectionChanges([1, 1, 3, 3, 2]);
// 1
Equal consecutive readings are ignored. The effective sequence is [1, 3, 2].

countDirectionChanges([4, 4, 4]);
// 0
There is no increasing or decreasing trend.

countDirectionChanges([]);
// 0
Input
readings is an array of integers.

Output
Return the number of times the trend changes direction.

Constraints
The array may be empty.
Every element is an integer.
Consecutive equal values are ignored.
After consecutive duplicates are ignored, fewer than three readings produce 0.
