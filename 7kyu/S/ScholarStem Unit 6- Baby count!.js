ScholarStem: Unit 6- Baby count! 
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5702f077e55d30a7af000115


A local birthing center is interested in names!

They have arrays of all the baby names they see each year, but the lists are sooo long! They donâ€™t know how to calculate how many times one name is used.

Given an array of names and a specific name string, return the number of times that specific name appears in the array.

countName( ["Tom","Bob","Harry","Bob"] , "Bob") //should return 2, since "Bob" shows up 2 times in the array


*/

const countName = (anArr, name) => anArr.filter(v=>v==name).length
