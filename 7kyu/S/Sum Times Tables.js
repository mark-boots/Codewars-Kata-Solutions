Sum Times Tables
https://www.codewars.com/kata/551e51155ed5ab41450006e1/train/javascript

Write a function which sums the result of the sums of the elements specified in table multiplied by all the numbers in between min and max including themselves.

For example, for table=[2,5], min=1, max=3 the result should be the same as

2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 +
5*1 + 5*2 + 5*3
i.e. the table of two from 1 to 3 plus the table of five from 1 to 3

All the numbers are integers but you must take in account:

table could be empty.
min could be negative.
max could be really big.
It is guaranteed that the input min <= max
